# Experimental Remote Mobile Control

This feature is disabled by default. It patches the upstream Codex Desktop main
bundle so Linux can try the mobile remote-control host flow that upstream
currently limits to macOS.

Enable it by adding the feature id to `linux-features/features.json` before
building:

```json
{
  "enabled": [
    "remote-mobile-control"
  ]
}
```

For the Nix flake build, use the declarative app variant instead because the
git-ignored `features.json` file is not part of the flake source:

```bash
nix run .#remote-mobile-control
```

Feature-specific Nix outputs are additive. To combine this feature with the
Computer Use UI opt-in:

```bash
nix run .#computer-use-ui-remote-mobile-control
```

What it changes:

- Replaces the macOS-only `remote-control-device-key.node` requirement with a
  Linux JavaScript ECDSA P-256 key provider.
- Lets the remote-control Connections UI render on Linux when upstream marks
  the feature unavailable or withholds the remote-control visibility rollout.
- Persists the private key material at
  `~/.config/codex-desktop/remote-control-device-keys-v1.json` with `0600`
  file permissions.
- Preserves `remote_control = true` / `features.remote_control = true` in the
  local Codex config instead of letting upstream strip it before app-server
  startup.
- Updates remote-control settings and Codex mobile setup copy so the Linux flow
  is not described as Mac-only.
- Stages `.codex-linux/cold-start.d/remote-mobile-control`, a feature-owned
  cold-start hook that provisions the upstream managed standalone daemon runtime
  when it is missing, then starts the managed app-server daemon with
  `remote-control start`.

Remote mobile daemon requirement:

The interactive Codex CLI and the remote-control daemon are separate concerns.
You can keep using a Homebrew-installed `codex` for normal terminal and Desktop
app-server usage, but Android remote control currently expects the upstream
managed standalone daemon runtime at:

```bash
~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/codex
```

If that binary is missing, the feature's cold-start hook runs the upstream
standalone installer with `CODEX_INSTALL_DIR` pointed at a private bin directory
under `~/.codex/packages/standalone/.bin`. That satisfies the managed daemon
layout without changing `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, creating `~/.local/bin/codex`, or
adding PATH blocks to your shell profile.

The hook is launched best-effort in the background by the generic launcher hook
runner. When the system `timeout` command is available, the installer/start path
is capped by
`CODEX_REMOTE_CONTROL_DAEMON_AUTOSTART_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `30`), so
Desktop cold start is not blocked by network, GitHub, or installer stalls.
Hook output is written to the launcher cache as `remote-mobile-control.log`.

On NixOS, prefer the flake's Home Manager module instead of the launcher hook:

```nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.codex-desktop-linux.homeManagerModules.default
  ];

  programs.codexDesktopLinux = {
    enable = true;
    computerUseUi.enable = true;
    remoteMobileControl.enable = true;
    remoteControl.enable = true;
  };
}
```

The module installs the remote-mobile package variant and manages
`codex-remote-control.service` as a user systemd unit running
`codex app-server --remote-control --listen unix://`. It also sets
`CODEX_REMOTE_CONTROL_DAEMON_AUTOSTART_DISABLED=1` so the launcher does not
start a second mutable standalone daemon.

This is compatible with immutable Linux systems such as Bluefin / Universal
Blue because the managed daemon runtime is user-scoped state under
`~/.codex/packages/standalone`. It does not require `dnf`, `rpm-ostree`, host
package layering, or base-OS mutation. The private `.bin` directory is only a
launcher-owned target for the installer symlink; it is not prepended to the
user's persistent shell `PATH`.

Set `CODEX_REMOTE_CONTROL_RUNTIME_AUTO_INSTALL_DISABLED=1` to disable that
runtime provisioning and only use an already-installed standalone runtime.

To force a specific daemon binary without affecting the interactive CLI, set:

```bash
CODEX_REMOTE_CONTROL_CODEX_PATH=/path/to/standalone/codex
```

To keep Desktop using Homebrew while the daemon uses standalone, set
`CODEX_CLI_PATH` to the Brew binary and leave
`CODEX_REMOTE_CONTROL_CODEX_PATH` unset or pointed at the standalone binary.

KDE Plasma smoke check:

Mobile control depends on the Linux Computer Use backend once the host is
enrolled. On Plasma/Wayland, verify that the KWin backend is ready after
building or installing the package:

```bash
./codex-app/resources/plugins/openai-bundled/plugins/computer-use/bin/codex-computer-use-linux doctor
./codex-app/resources/plugins/openai-bundled/plugins/computer-use/bin/codex-computer-use-linux windows
```

The doctor report should show the KWin window backend, XDG Desktop Portal, and
input checks as ready. The windows report should return `"backend": "kwin"` with
a non-empty `windows` list.

Known risks:

- This is not equivalent to macOS Secure Enclave-backed storage. Private key
  material is file-backed and protected by ordinary user file permissions.
- OpenAI may still reject Linux host enrollment server-side. This feature only
  removes local macOS-only blockers in the repackaged app.
- Treat this as experimental account-level remote-control plumbing.

Run the feature tests with:

```bash
node --test linux-features/remote-mobile-control/test.js
```
